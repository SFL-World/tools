Anyone can create or edit any tool, and I can provide you with an API to get any farm information, like in the skill tree tool

# Skill Trainer
Skill tree calculator (AI generated)
### TODO
+ Add a sibling page skills_compare that accepts select1 and select2 query params and presents a skills comparison (show me the added/removed of 1 vs 2)
+ Show order indicators, it could be helpful to assist explaining the "flow" of skill selection when comparing notes between players

# Resource Price History
Trading View for resources (AI generated)
#### TODO
+ Highlighting on the chart: Week transitions, season changes, chapter updates, and important events like FLOWER token withdrawals (I'll build an API for this feature)
+ Comparing price changes between two resource pairs, like Wood/FLOWER and Rock/FLOWER (601.csv and 602.csv)
+ Adding multiple resources to the chart
+ Adding resource USD values to the chart
+ Adding indicators like a simple moving average (SMA)
